Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. I used easybook template in my site, you can find it here [EasyBook theme](https://github.com/laobubu/jekyll-theme-EasyBook/).

I also used a **python script** ( [here's the script]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/automating-post-generation-with-python) ) to automatically name my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
