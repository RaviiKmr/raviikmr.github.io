Windows Photo Viewer is a built-in image viewer program in Windows operating system. Sometimes we face this problem which is Window Photo Viewer gets very slow and when we open any photo it loads it very slowly. Sometimes it takes more than 5 seconds to load the image.

I have found a solution to this problem. I have made a video explaining how to solve this issue.
Watch the video below.
